              So in 2007, Li began working on what would later become GPT-3.0, a
              collection of 3.2 million images tagged by humans to train an AI
              algorithm. When his team began using its library to better mark
              images than humans, the Pentagon believed it was time to look at
              how artificial intelligence could improve weapons. He created a
              dataset that, with the help of the National Institute of Standards
              and Technology (NIST), triggered a race to the top for perfect
              image recognition.
